### Machine Learning with Python and SciKitLearn

Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.[2] It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python.

It is licensed under a permissive simplified BSD license and is distributed under many Linux distributions, encouraging academic and commercial use.

The library is built upon the SciPy (Scientific Python) that must be installed before you can use scikit-learn. This stack that includes:

NumPy: Base n-dimensional array package
SciPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing
Matplotlib: Comprehensive 2D/3D plotting
IPython: Enhanced interactive console
Sympy: Symbolic mathematics
Pandas: Data structures and analysis
Extensions or modules for SciPy care conventionally named SciKits. As such, the module provides learning algorithms and is named scikit-learn.

The vision for the library is a level of robustness and support required for use in production systems. This means a deep focus on concerns such as easy of use, code quality, collaboration, documentation and performance.

Although the interface is Python, c-libraries are leverage for performance such as numpy for arrays and matrix operations, LAPACK, LibSVM and the careful use of cython.

### Who is using Scikitlearn?
The scikit-learn testimonials page lists Inria, Mendeley, wise.io , Evernote, Telecom ParisTech and AWeber as users of the library.

If this is a small indication of companies that have presented on their use, then there are very likely tens to hundreds of larger organizations using the library.

It has good test coverage and managed releases and is suitable for prototype and production projects alike.

### Scikitlearn Resources
If you are interested in learning more, checkout the Scikit-Learn homepage that includes documentation and related resources.

You can get the code from the github repository, and releases are historically available on the Sourceforge project.

### Scikitlearn Documentation
I recommend starting out with the quick-start tutorial and flicking through the user guide and example gallery for algorithms that interest you.

Ultimately, scikit-learn is a library and the API reference will be the best documentation for getting things done. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#
